SFS Pro supports two flexible licensing models designed to fit the needs of your firm.

#### Named License

A named license is tied to a specific user and can be used on any number of computers by that same user. This is perfect for someone that works on both a desktop and a laptop and needs to run the software on both. It guarantees that a license will always be available for that person to create, edit, and export SFS documents.

#### Floating License

A floating license is sometimes referred to as a “per seat” license. Instead of being tied to a specific person, it guarantees you a certain number of concurrent users. For example, if you have three members of your firm, and any of them could create, edit, or export a SFS document, but only one of them will be doing it at a time, a single floating license is likely your best bet.
